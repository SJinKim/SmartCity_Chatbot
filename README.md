# Smart-City-Chatbot (LegalBot) üìù‚ûúüìöü§ñ‚ûúüìÑ

*kurze Introduction: evtl. mit Screenshot vom Aufbau und GIF als kurzes Preview*
A helpful AI Chatbot assistant for german legal inquiries. 

This repository contains the code for a chatbot that generates an official notice (`Bescheid`) based on the legal document (`Sachverhalt`) uploaded by the user. The chatbot leverages stored legal statutes from a database (using `LangChain`) including state and federal laws (`Landesgesetze` and `Bundesgesetze`) and utilizes the OpenAi's LLM model (`GPT 3.5`) for text generation.

## Features 

üñäÔ∏è  **Legal Assistance**: 
The chatbot is context-aware and can answer questions based on the uploaded legal document (`Sachverhalt`) using the LLM model (`GPT 3.5`)

üñäÔ∏è  **`Bescheid`-Generation**: 
The chatbot analyzes the uploaded legal document (in `DOCX` and `PDF`) and automatically generates a draft of the legal notice (`Bescheid`).

üñäÔ∏è  **Manual Download**: 
The user can manually download the generated draft of the legal notice in both `DOCX` and `PDF` formats.

## Disclaimer

This chatbot uses AI to generate legal notices (`Bescheid`) from legal documents (`Sachverhalt`) uploaded by users. The chatbot is not a legal advisor and does not ensure the accuracy or validity of the notices or information. Users must verify the notices and information with their own legal counsel or other sources. The chatbot and its creators are not liable for any harm or loss from using the chatbot or the information. Users agree to these terms by using the chatbot.
