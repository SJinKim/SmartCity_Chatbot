# Smart-City-Chatbot (LegalBot) üìÑ‚ûúüìöü§ñ‚ûúü™Ñüìù‚ûú‚úâÔ∏è

This repository provides a user-friendly AI chatbot assistant to support German legal inquiries. The chatbot generates legal notices (`Bescheide`) based on user-uploaded case files (`Sachverhalte`), offers customization options before finalizing the file, and has potential for further expansion and integration.

## Features 
![](https://i.postimg.cc/zXWRQ7QT/SCB-preview.png)

üìå The chatbot is still under development and based on a dataset of German federal laws and the state laws of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.

üñäÔ∏è  **Smart Legal Assistance**: 
The chatbot analyzes the uploaded case file (`Sachverhalte`) in `DOCX` or `PDF` format and offers context-aware responses leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. 

üñäÔ∏è  **Automated Notice Generation**: 
The chatbot generates draft legal notices (`Bescheide`) based on the uploaded case file and the user's input. The legal notice includes the decision of the authority, the legal justification for the decision, and information on legal remedies.

üñäÔ∏è  **Customization**: 
The user can review and edit the generated draft notice before finalizing it through customization options such as adding additional information or changing the existing content.

üñäÔ∏è  **Downloadable**: 
The user can manually download the generated legal notice in text format (`DOCX`).


## Walkthrough (Tips)
üèÉ Upload case file by clicking on the upload button (`HOCHLADEN`).
- Now the chatbot will create a draft legal notice for you, which takes a short amount of time.
- You will receive the generated legal notice as a message in the chat.
      
üèÉ Adjust the draft legal notice according to the desired adjustments:
- For best customization results, use phrases like:
```
PROMPT: "√Ñndere mir den Bescheid [specify the part you want to change] [specify the adjustment you want to make]"
```
         
üèÉ You can ask questions about the uploaded case file or the generated legal notice, as well as generated questions if you wish.
- For the best results, mention the case file or legal notice directly as the specific words in your question: `Sachverhalt` or `Bescheid`.
      
üèÉ Click the download button (`HERUNTERLADEN`) to download the generated and customized legal notice.
